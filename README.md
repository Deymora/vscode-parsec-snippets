# vscode-parsec-snippets

## Features

This plugin provides snippets with the basic usage syntax for the most used components of Parsec Next.

All you need to do is typing the component's name **all in lowercase** and press tab. (all components will follow this logic).

``` html
pbtn + [tab] =>
<parsec-btn
    @click=""
    :label="$t('')"
    :icon=""
    :tooltip="$t('')"
/>
```
